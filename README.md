This is a repository based on my own tinkering with an FPGA board.

## Binary Arithmatic with IO Shield
This is a basic example of using the IO shield with binary representations of numbers to dispay addition, subtraction and multiplication.

## Analog Read

Read an analog signal with the XADC module. Depending on the analog signal a PWM pulse is changed to adjust the brightness of the onboard LEDs.

### Infra-Red Distance Sensor

This takes in a signal from an IR distance sensor.
